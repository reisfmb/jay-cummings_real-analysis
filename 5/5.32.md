# Prove that the only sets with empty boundary are $\mathbb R$ and $\emptyset$.

Clearly, if $A = \emptyset$, then no $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x \in \mathbb R$ will be able to intercept both $A$ and $A^c$, because $A$ is empty, therefore $\partial A = \emptyset$.

Similarly, if $A = \mathbb R$, then no $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x \in \mathbb R$ will be able to intercept both $A$ and $A^c$, because $A^c$ is empty, therefore $\partial A = \emptyset$.

Now, suppose $A$ is a non empty proper subset of $\mathbb R$, so there is an $x \in A^c$. Consider then the following two sets:

$$
B=\{a\in A \quad \mid \quad a < x\}\\
C=\{a\in A \quad \mid \quad a > x\}
$$

## Case 1) $B$ xor $C$ is empty

 WLOG suppose, that $C$ is empty. Therefore $\sup B \in \partial A$, which shows that for such $A$, its boundary is not empty.

So we know that uppose that $B$ and $C$ are not empty, therefore $b=\sup B$ and $c=\inf C$ exists. Note as well that $b\leq c$ and $A=B\dot\cup C$.

## Case 2) $b=c$

Suppose $b=c$. Clearly, $b\leq x$ and $c \geq x$, therefore $b=x=c$, therefore $\{x\} \in \partial A$.

## Case 3) $b<c$

Now if $b < c$ then we know that $\{b,c\} \in \partial A$, since every $\epsilon$-neighborhood of both $b$ and $c$ intercepts both $A$ and $A^c$.
