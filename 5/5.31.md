## a) Find the interior, exterior and boundary for each of the following sets: $(0,1)$, $[0,1]$, $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb Q$.

- $(0,1)$
  - interior: $(0,1)$
  - exterior: $(-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty)$
  - boundary: $\{0,1\}$
- $[0,1]$
  - interior: $(0,1)$
  - exterior: $(-\infty,0)\cup(1,\infty)$
  - boundary: $\{0,1\}$
- $\mathbb R$
  - interior: $\mathbb R$
  - exterior: $\emptyset$
  - boundary: $\emptyset$
- $\mathbb Q$
  - interior: $\emptyset$
  - exterior: $\emptyset$
  - boundary: $\mathbb R$

## b) Prove that for any set A, we have $\mathbb R = \text{Int}(A) \cup \partial A \cup \text{Ext}(A)$, and this is a disjoint union.

Take $x \in \mathbb R$. 

If there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \subset A$, then $x \in \text{Int}(A)$. 

If this is not the case, than for every $\epsilon > 0$, we have that $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \cap A^c \neq \emptyset$. 

Now, if for some $\epsilon$, it follows that $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \subset A^c$, the $x\in \text{Ext}(A)$.

Finally, if that is not the case, then for every $\epsilon > 0$ we have that $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \not\subset A^c$, therefore $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \cap A \neq \emptyset$ and $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \cap A^c \neq \emptyset$, which makes $x\in \partial A$.

Those sets  are disjoint by their definition. 

To see that, suppose an element $x$ is both an interior and a boundary point of $A$, then, by definition of interior point, it follows that there is $\epsilon > 0$ such that the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ is contained in $A$. By definition of boundary, it follows that every $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ intercepts both $A$ and $A^c$. This leads to a contraction, because the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ can't be contained on $A$ and intecept $A^c$, threfore $\text{Int}(A) \cap \partial A = \emptyset$. 

The argument to show $\text{Ext}(A) \cap \partial A = \emptyset$ is basically the same.

Finally, suppose $x$ is both an interior and an exterior point of $A$. Then, by their definitions, there are $\epsilon_1>0$ and $\epsilon_2>0$ such that the $\epsilon_1$-neighborhood of $x$ is contained on $A$ and the $\epsilon_2$-neighborhood of $x$ is contained on $A^c$. This is a contradiction, because the first conclusion leads to $x \in A$ and the second leads to $x \in A^c$, so $x$ can't be both an interior and an exterior point at the same, which implies that $\text{Int}(A) \cap \text{Ext}(A) = \emptyset$, as desired.
