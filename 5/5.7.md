## Prove that a point $x$ is a limit point of a set $A$ if and only if every $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ at some point other than $x$.

### $\rightarrow$
Let $A$ be a set, $x$ a limit point of $A$ and $\epsilon > 0$. We want to show that $(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \neq \emptyset$. Note that, by definition of $x$ being a limit point of $A$, there exists a sequence $(a_n)$ of terms of $A\setminus \{x\}$ such that $(a_n) \rightarrow x$, therefore, $\exists N \in \mathbb N$ such that $|a_n-x| < \epsilon$, which implies that $x-\epsilon<a_n<x+\epsilon$ which proves that the desired intersection is not empty.

### $\leftarrow$
Suppose that every $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ at some point other than $x$. We'll show that $x$ is a limit point of $A$. To show that, we need to find a sequence $a_n$ in $A\setminus\{x\}$ such that $(a_n) \rightarrow x$. Since $(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon) \cap (A \setminus \{x\}) \neq \emptyset$ for every $\epsilon$, its sufficient to take $a_n$ as an element in that intersection when $\epsilon = \frac 1n$.
