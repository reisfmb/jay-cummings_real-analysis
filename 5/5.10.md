## Show that the set of limit points of a set is closed.

Let $A$ be a set and $L$ the set of its limits points. We want to show that $L$ is closed.

Aiming for a contradiction, suppose $L$ is not closed, i.e, $L^c$ is not open. 

$L^c$ not being open, implies on the existance of some $x\in L^c$, such that for every $\epsilon >0$, $(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \subsetneq L^c \implies(x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon) \cap L \neq \emptyset$, which makes $x$ a limit point of $L$.

Since $x$ is a limit point of $L$, there exists a sequence $(l_n)$ in $L$ such that $(l_n) \rightarrow x$. 

Now, since $l_n \in L$ for every $n$, and $L$ is the set of limit points of $A$, then there is a sequence $(a_k^n)$ in $A$ such that $(a_k^n) \rightarrow l_n$. 

With that, we can construct a new sequence $(b_n)$ in $A$ such that $(b_n) \rightarrow x$. To see that, define:

$b_n := a_k^n$ where $k$ is first natural number in which $a_k^n \in (l_n- \frac 1n, l_n + \frac 1n)$. Such $k$ always exists since $(a_k^n) \rightarrow l_n$.

With that definition, we'll show that $b_n \rightarrow x$. 

Take $\epsilon_1 > 0$. Since $(l_n) \rightarrow x$, there exists $N_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $l_n \in (x-\epsilon_1, x+\epsilon_1)$ for all $n>N_1$. 

Now take $\epsilon_2 > 0$ sufficiently small to make $(l_n-\epsilon_2, l_n+\epsilon_2) \subset (x-\epsilon_1, x+\epsilon_1)$. For such $\epsilon_2$ there exists a $N_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b_n \in (l_n-\epsilon_2, l_n+\epsilon_2)$ for all $n>N_2$.

Then for every $n>\max\{N_1,N_2\}$, it is true that $b_n \in (x-\epsilon_1,x+\epsilon_1)$ which shows that $(b_n)\rightarrow x$.

Therefore $x$ is a limit point of $A$, so it should be in $L$, which is a contradiction to the fact that $x \in L^c$.

This contradiction came by assuming $L$ was not closed, therefore $L$ is indeed closed, as desired.
