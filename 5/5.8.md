## Construct a set $A$ whose set of limit points is $\mathbb{Z}$.

$$
A = \bigcup_{z\in\mathbb{Z}}A_z=\left\{z+\frac 1n \quad \mid \quad n \in \mathbb{N}^+\right\}
$$

By construction, it is clear that for any $z\in\mathbb{Z}$ we can find a sequence in $A\setminus \{z\}$ such that it converges to $z$, e.g, $a_n = z+\frac 1n$.

Now let $x\in \mathbb{R}\setminus{Z}$. Note that its possible to isolate $x$ from $A$ by picking a sufficiently small $\epsilon$. Since that's the case, then the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$ does not intercept $A\setminus\{x\}$, which implies that there's no sequence on $A\setminus\{x\}$ converging to $x$, so $x$ is not a limit point of $A$.
