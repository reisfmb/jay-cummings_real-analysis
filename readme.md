# Jay Cummings - Real Analyis, a long-form textbook
This is my preferred real analysis book. I think Jay did an excellent job on his long-form approach.

In the end of the theory on each chapter, Jay wrote a section entitled "Notable exercises", in which some exercises are highlighted.

This repo is an attempt to give answers to every notable exercises on the book.

# Errors & contributions
Even though I'm doing my best to come up with correct solutions, there might be errors on some of them. Feel free to contribute with corrections via pull requests.

Eventually, I'd like to have solutions for all exercises on the book, so feel free to open PR's with your own solutions for new exercises. Credits will be given for each contribution.
