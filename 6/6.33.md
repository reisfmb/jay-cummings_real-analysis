# Prove that if $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is continuous and $[a,b] \subset X$, then $f([a,b]) = [c,d]$ for some $c,d\in\mathbb R$.

Due to continuity of $f$ know that $f([a,b])$ is compact, therefore its bounded, and since it is not empty, we know that $\inf$ and $\sup$ exists. Call them $I$ and $S$.

So far we know that $f([a,b])\sub[I,S]$. It remains to show $[I,S]\sub f([a,b])$.

By the extreme value theorem, there are $i,s\in[a,b]$ such that $f(i) = I$ and $f(s) = S$, so $\{I,S\} \in f([a,b])$. It remains to show that $(I,S) \sub f([a,b])$.

Take any $y \in (f(i),f(s))$, and suppose, WLOG, that $i < s$. By intermediate value theorem, it follows that there is a $c \in (i,s)$ such that $f(c)=y$. Since $(i,s)\subset [a,b], it implies that $y \in f([a,b])$, concluding that $[I,S]\sub f([a,b])$.
