# Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]$ be a continuous function. Prove that $f(x) = x$ for some $x$.

Define $g(x) = f(x) - x$. If we are able to show that there is a $c$ in the domain such that $g(c)=0$, then we are done.

Note that if $f(0) = 0$ or $f(1) = 1$, then we are already done. Suppose that is not the case, therefore $f(0) > 0$ and $f(1) < 1$. 

It follows that $g(0)=f(0) > 0$ and $g(1) = f(1) - 1 < 0$, therefore, $g(0)$ and $g(1)$ have different signs, and by intermediate value theorem there is a $c \in (0,1)$ such that $g(c) = 0$, as desired.
