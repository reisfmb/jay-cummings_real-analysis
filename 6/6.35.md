# Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be a continuous function with $f(0) = f(1)$. Show that there must exist $x,y \in [0,1]$ which are of distance $1/2$ apart (i.e  |x-y| = 1/2) for which $f(x)=f(y)$.

Define $g:\left[0,\frac 12\right] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ by $g(x)=f(x)-f(x+\frac 12)$. Note then that if we are able to prove that there is some $c \in \left[0,\frac 12\right]$ such that $g(c)=0$, then we're done.

Note that $g(0) = f(0) - f(\frac 12)$ and $g(\frac 12) = f(\frac 12) - f(1)$. Since $f(0) = f(1)$, we conclude that $g(0) = -g(1)$.

Finally, $g$ is a continuous function (innherited from $f$), therefore there must exist $c\in\left[0,\frac 12\right]$ wuch that $g(c) = 0$, which proves what we're looking for.
