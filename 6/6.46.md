# Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions on $[a,b]$, and suppose that $f(a)<g(a)$ while $f(b) > g(b)$. Prove that $f(c)=g(c)$ for some $c \in [a,b]$.

Define a function $h$ on the same domain such that $h(x) = f(x)-g(x)$. 

Note that $h$ is continuous, $h(a) < 0$ and $h(b) > 0$, therefore, there must exist some $c \in [a,b]$ such that $h(c) = 0$.

Finally, for such $c$, we have: $f(c)-g(c)=0 \implies f(c)=g(c)$.
