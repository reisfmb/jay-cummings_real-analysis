# Prove that $g: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ has the intermediate value property, where $g(x) = \begin{cases} x\sin(\frac 1x) \quad &\text{if} \quad x \neq 0\\0 \quad &\text{if} \quad x = 0 \end{cases}$

We want to prove that for every $\alpha \in (g(0),g(1))$ there is a $c \in (0,1)$ such that $g(c)=\alpha$.

Start by fixing such $\alpha$ and define the $f_\alpha(x) = g(x) - \alpha$. Note that $g$ is continuous on $[0,1]$, (since $\lim_{x\to0^+} g(x) = 0$) therefore $f_\alpha$ is as well.

Now the problem reduces to find $c\in (0,1)$ such that $f_\alpha(c)=0$. 

By definition of $f_\alpha$, it follows that $f_\alpha(0) = g(0) - \alpha = -\alpha$ and since $\alpha > g(0) = 0$, consequently $f_\alpha(0) < 0$. Simillarly $f_\alpha(1) = g(1) - \alpha$, ans since $0 < \alpha < g(1)$, it follows that $f_\alpha(1) > 0$.

By intermediate value theorem, there must exist some $c\in (0,1)$ such that $f_\alpha(c) = 0$, which implies that $g(c) = \alpha$, as desired.
